# E-Commerce-shopping-cart
SmartCart is a simple, console-based e-commerce shopping cart application developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to view a product catalog, add items to their cart, view and manage their cart contents, and proceed to checkout. Upon checkout, the application generates a receipt and saves it to a text file using Java File I/O.

This project includes core classes like Product, CartItem, ShoppingCart, and ReceiptGenerator, ensuring a clean and modular design. The user interacts with the system through a text-based menu interface, selecting options by entering numerical choices. The application is ideal for beginners looking to understand OOP, collection frameworks, and basic Java file handling in a real-world scenario.

SmartCart is easily extendable to include features like user authentication, product categories, or integration with a database or GUI.
