SmartShop is a console-based shopping cart application built in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## 📄 Features  
- Add products to a virtual shopping cart  
- Calculate total and generate receipt at checkout  
- Save receipts to a text file using file I/O  
- Organized with object-oriented design (inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)  
- Easy to extend with GUI or database in the future  
## 💡 Technologies Used  
- Java 17+  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
